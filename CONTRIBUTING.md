# Criteria for inclusion

As of September 22nd 2021, we have decided that not every single ROM that is released will make it into this list.

The following new criteria have been set for the inclusion of custom ROMs into this list:

1. The source code of the ROM has to be open-source and free from kangs or other discrepancies.

2. The person developing and maintaining the custom ROM has to have a remote idea of what they are doing. Buildbotted ROMs and such will not be accepted. This point will be evaluated individually for every entry on this list.

3. The custom ROM has to be up-to-date. That means that we will not accept custom ROMs that haven't been updated for longer than 2 months.

Depending on the individual case, we are entitled to make exceptions from these criteria, especially if the ROM in question is very popular and / or well-made.

This criteria is, as well as any other part of this site, not final and subject to change at all times.
