# Criteria for inclusion

As of September 22nd, 2021, we have decided that not every single ROM and kernel that is released will make it into this list.

The following new criteria have been set for the inclusion of released builds into this list:

1. The source code of the ROM has to be open-source and free of general discrepancies. If the build in question is a custom kernel, the complete kernel tree has to be available on GitHub, in accordance to the GNU General Public License.

2. The person developing and maintaining the build has to have a remote idea of what they are doing. Buildbotted ROMs and such will not be accepted. In general, entries that have the common opinion of being bad, malicious or being delivered with broken features can be excluded. This point will be evaluated individually for every entry on this list.

3. The build has to be up-to-date. That means that we will not accept custom ROMs and kernels that haven't been updated for longer than 2 months. We will make exclusions in this point, particularly for custom recoveries.

Depending on the individual case, we are entitled to making exceptions from these criteria, especially if the ROM in question is very popular and / or well-made.

This criteria is, as well as any other part of this site, not final and subject to change at all times.
